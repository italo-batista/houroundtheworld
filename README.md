**Hour** ar**ound the world**   :clock1:

This is my very first **React.js** app :smile: Just for fun and learning

Some functionalities of this app are: 
- Compare current time in different places in the world with the userâ€™s current location
- Select a city, a date and a time (in the future or in the past) and convert this time to its corresponding in other places in the world.

To run app:
```
cd app && npm install && npm start
```
Open on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
